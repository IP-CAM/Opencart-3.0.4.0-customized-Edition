# OpenCart

## Overview
OpenCart is a free open source ecommerce platform for online merchants. OpenCart provides a professional and reliable foundation from which to build a successful online store.

## Description
This is a customized version of OpenCart [3.0.x.x](https://github.com/opencart/opencart/tree/3.0.x.x) branch and **fully compatible** with it and other *official* OpenCart 3.x releases. The main difference is that some third-party modules have been removed, mainly - payment and shipping modules, google shopping, etc. [*Here*](deleted.txt) is the full list of deleted files. Also PHP code have been beautified and fixed to meet the [coding standards](https://github.com/opencart/opencart/wiki/Coding-standards).
The project is actively used, so all *official* fixes are synchronized in time.
